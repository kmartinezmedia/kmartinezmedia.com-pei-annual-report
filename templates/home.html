            <h1 class="white-header">DEAR SHAREHOLDERS</h1>

            <p class="white-header-body">2013 marked Perry Ellis International’s (‘PEI’) 20th year as a publicly traded
                company, solidifying our position as one of the largest branded lifestyle apparel companies in the
                world. It was an honor to ring the closing bell at NASDAQ with our fellow associates, to reflect on our
                historic achievements and to continue our celebration at the Hippodrome Building, as we inaugurated
                PEI’s new regional headquarters in New York.</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">This year was also an extremely difficult environment at retail, which
                resulted in a revenue decline for our company. As the year unfolded, our company undertook a series of
                strategic restructuring initiatives to address the macro issues affecting the industry and PEI. As a
                result, in part of these actions, we experienced revenue declines attributable to the reduction of our
                private labels and exclusive retail brands. For Fiscal 2014 and 2013, these programs accounted for 18%
                and 22% of our company’s total revenues, respectively.</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">We project these programs will account for 16% of total revenues by
                the end of Fiscal 2015. To compensate for these revenue losses, our company instituted an infrastructure
                rationalization program this year. We identified substantial savings that will be recognized in Fiscal
                2015 and we renewed our credit facility and mortgages at more favorable rates, thereby reducing interest
                costs. These steps were taken to streamline our business model and put our muscle and our money against
                our power brands: Perry Ellis®, Original Penguin® by Munsingwear®, Savane®, Farah®, Rafaella®, Laundry
                by Shelli Segal®, and Ben Hogan®, as well our branded licensed portfolio: Callaway®, PGA TOUR®, Jack
                Nicklaus®, and Nike® Swim.</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">Despite these challenges, we want to share some positive achievements
                that we recorded:</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">• Original Penguin by Munsingwear, Savane and Nike Swim each achieved
                one of their best years at wholesale, achieving double-digit growth for each brand.</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">• Rafaella realized improved profitability as the team exited
                lower-margin label programs and focused efforts on the core brand itself.</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">• PEI’s golf business solidified its dominant position as a global
                golf apparel vendor. Our Ben Hogan label more than doubled its revenue. We expanded our global reach
                under the Callaway Golf license to include Europe, the Middle East and Africa. And we launched the
                powerful licensed Jack Nicklaus brand in the fourth quarter.</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">• We achieved growth across each international market where we
                currently operate, namely Canada, Europe, and Mexico. Overall, our combined international wholesale,
                retail and licensing businesses now account for 10% of our company’s total business.</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">• We executed 13 new domestic and 5 new international licensing
                agreements, and our licensing revenues increased approximately 10% for the full-year, from $27M to $30M.
                In addition, our international licensing partners opened 27 new licensed stores, with 16 across Latin
                America and 11 across Asia--a testament to the global strength of our brands.</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">• We added two new direct distribution websites for the Callaway Golf
                and Farah brands, bringing the total number of e-commerce platforms we operate to 8.</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">With our go-forward strategies in place, we are excited to share the
                following initiatives:</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">
                <span class="medium">• Win with Winning Retailers:</span>
                Because just less than 80% of our business comes from our domestic wholesale partners, aligning our
                brands, products and marketing strategies with those partners who can drive mutually beneficial,
                profitable growth is at the center of our strategy. We are investing capital to install shops and
                enhance fixtures at key retail flagship locations for our Perry Ellis, Original Penguin, and Rafaella
                brands, enabling our company to secure prime floor space at retail and drive profitable sales in top
                locations around the country.</p>

            <p class="white-header-body-children">
                <span class="medium">• Expand Our Product Offerings:</span>
                Our company was initially built on the strength of its expertise in men’s sportswear. Since then, we
                have grown across multiple product categories, including swim, women’s sportswear and performance golf
                apparel. In 2013, we broadened our golf offerings with the launch of the women’s golf apparel
                collection. This year, Ben Hogan Signature Collection will be leading efforts with a series of new
                product categories including golf balls, golf gloves, hats, visors, belts, towels and umbrellas.

            <p class="white-header-body-children">We have built a distinguished company with a foundation that ensures
                both success and longevity and our culture has been carefully nurtured by the thousands of people who
                have worked with us over time. It is a culture that enables us to take risks, allowing us to succeed
                brilliantly, and sometimes to fail…because we know that those around us will help pick us up, dust us
                off and push us to do better. The PEI culture gives us strength; it unites us and gives us the potential
                to succeed and grow as one.</p>

                    <p class="brand-body">Perry Ellis was the master of making it all look easy. He played with fashion
                        convention simply by not taking it so seriously. Following only what felt right. Dressing up
                        dressed-down. Eschewing etiquette while simultaneously elevating it. With playful patterns and
                        uncommon proportions, he rewrote the book on fashion. Today, his legacy lives on in a whole new
                        generation of easygoing trailblazers.</p>

                    <p class="brand-body">The Perry Ellis® brand offers a full lifestyle sportswear collection: dressier
                        suit separates, mix and match shirts, trousers, knits, sweaters and outerwear. We stand for
                        innate personal style, not following fads; having it together without trying too hard. There has
                        never been a better time to be...Very Perry Ellis.</p>

                    <p class="brand-body">The Original Penguin® brand is a youth culture icon that represents a mix of
                        American Sportswear and contemporary fashion appealing to a style savvy consumer who’s into
                        details, but doesn’t take fashion too seriously. We pay homage to our brand heritage, while
                        being flexible enough to stay culturally relevant in our global markets, reworking our archive
                        of mid-century classics to reflect today’s lifestyle without compromising that heritage or the
                        craftsmanship that established the Original Penguin name. This year, we launched The Earl 2.0, a
                        modern design update to the classic Earl Polo, and the P55 Chino, our answer to a wearable
                        bottom for both casual and refined needs. Because you can’t stay “Original” by doing what you’ve
                        always done.</p>

                        the next one.” It’s as true in the golf apparel business as in the game. The line is styled,
                        designed and infused with the top-notch performance he demanded. He prided himself on the idea
                        that “there are no shortcuts in the quest for perfection.” This has become the brand’s mantra.
                        The Ben Hogan® collection is reflective of the legend himself--exceptional style sense with a
