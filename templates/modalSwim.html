 <p>The Swim business is an open competition, and every second counts. We weave fashion and performance into one streamlined business that’s primed to go the distance for our consumers and our investors. Continuously working to offer athletes unrivaled innovation, we aim to be the fastest. Meanwhile, our fashion swimwear brands build on a lasting heritage of style. Whether it’s cutting edge technology and performance, active-inspired athletic suits or innovation from the body experts that “changed bathing to swimming,” we strive to be the best on the blocks. And on the beach.</p>
